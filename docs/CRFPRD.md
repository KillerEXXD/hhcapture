## Business Overview

### The Original Problem

**Crawfish Dealer Operations:**

- Buys 100-125 racks/day from wholesaler
- Each rack: 35-49 lbs (avg 40 lbs)
- Profit margin: $0.75/lb
- Daily volume: ~4,480 lbs
- Daily profit: $3,360
- Annual profit: ~$1.2M per dealer

**Current Process (Manual):**

- Rack weights tracked on paper (10×50 grid)
- Restaurant orders via text messages
- Delivery assignments via text to drivers
- Manual QuickBooks invoice entry
- Check payments (2-4 week wait)
- 15+ hours/week wasted on admin

**Pain Points:**

- Order errors cost $50-100K/year
- No real-time visibility
- Manual reconciliation
- Cash flow delays
- Scalability limited

-----

## Market Economics

### Single Vertical (Crawfish Only)

**Market Size:**

- 100+ crawfish dealers nationwide
- Average 50-75 restaurants per dealer
- 5,000+ total restaurant endpoints
- ~$530M total industry GMV

**Per Dealer Economics:**

- Annual revenue: $5.3M
- Annual profit: $1.2M (22% margin)
- Total pounds/year: 1,635,200 lbs
- Average order: 5-10 racks per restaurant

### Platform Model (Multi-Vertical)

**Expanded Market:**

- Crawfish: 100 dealers
- Chicken/Pork: 300 suppliers
- Produce: 500 distributors
- Seafood: 200 suppliers
- **Total: 1,100+ suppliers**

**Restaurant Economics:**

- 5,000 restaurants initially
- Each orders from 4-8 suppliers
- Average weekly spend: $3,000 across all suppliers
- Annual spend per restaurant: $156,000
- **Total platform GMV: $2.3B+ at scale**

**Network Effect Flywheel:**

1. Crawfish dealer joins → brings 50 restaurants
1. Restaurants use app for crawfish orders
1. Restaurants ask chicken supplier: “Can you use CrawTrack?”
1. Chicken supplier joins (customers requesting it)
1. Now restaurant orders crawfish + chicken in one app
1. Restaurant asks produce/seafood suppliers to join
1. Each new supplier increases platform value
1. Each new restaurant increases supplier adoption

-----

-----

## Revenue Models

### MODEL 1: Transaction-Based (0.75% of GMV)

**Structure:**

- FREE for suppliers to join
- FREE for restaurants (basic tier)
- 0.75% transaction fee on all orders
- Fee split: Restaurant 0.5%, Supplier 0.25%
- OR: Supplier pays full 0.75% (keeps restaurants 100% free)

**Revenue Projections:**

|Year|Restaurants|Avg Spend/Restaurant|GMV |Fee (0.75%)|Annual Revenue|
|----|-----------|--------------------|------|-----------|--------------|
|1 |1,000 |$156,000 |$156M |0.75% |$1.17M |
|2 |5,000 |$156,000 |$780M |0.75% |$5.85M |
|3 |15,000 |$156,000 |$2.34B|0.75% |$17.55M |
|5 |50,000 |$156,000 |$7.8B |0.75% |$58.5M |

**Advantages:**

- Zero barrier to entry (free to join)
- Scales automatically with volume
- Tiny percentage (psychologically acceptable)
- Viral adoption (restaurants recruit suppliers)

**Challenges:**

- Requires high transaction volume
- Revenue dependent on platform usage
- Need payment integration for visibility

-----

### MODEL 2: Per-Order Pricing

**Structure:**

- $0.50-1.00 per order processed
- Free for restaurants
- Free to join for suppliers

**Revenue Math:**

Average restaurant: 25 orders/week across all suppliers

- 25 orders × 52 weeks = 1,300 orders/year
- 1,300 × $0.75 = $975/year per restaurant
- 5,000 restaurants = **$4.875M annual revenue**

**From Supplier Perspective:**

- Supplier with 50 restaurants
- Each orders 1.5x/week = 75 orders/week
- 75 × $0.75 = $56/week = **$2,912/year per supplier**
- 1,100 suppliers = **$3.2M annual revenue**

**Year-by-Year Projections:**

|Year|Total Orders|Rate/Order|Annual Revenue|
|----|------------|----------|--------------|
|1 |1M |$0.75 |$750K |
|2 |5.2M |$0.75 |$3.9M |
|3 |15.6M |$0.75 |$11.7M |
|5 |52M |$0.75 |$39M |

**Advantages:**

- Super simple pricing (“75 cents per order”)
- Easy to calculate
- Fair (high-volume users pay more)
- Predictable for budgeting

-----

### MODEL 3: Per-Pound Pricing (Crawfish Only)

**Structure:**

- $0.01 per pound tracked
- $0 monthly minimum
- $0 setup fee

**Revenue Math:**

Per dealer: 1,635,200 lbs/year × $0.01 = **$16,352/year**

- 100 dealers = **$1.635M annual revenue**

**Advantages:**

- Simple (“one penny per pound”)
- Scales with volume
- Psychologically tiny (1.3% of profit margin)

**Limitations:**

- Only works for weight-based products
- Doesn’t scale to non-weight verticals

-----

### MODEL 4: Per-Rack Pricing (Crawfish Only)

**Structure:**

- $1-3 per rack processed
- All-in pricing

**Revenue Math:**

At $2/rack:

- 112 racks/day × $2 = $224/day
- $224 × 365 = $81,760/year per dealer
- 100 dealers = **$8.176M annual revenue**

At $4/rack:

- $163,520/year per dealer
- 100 dealers = **$16.35M annual revenue**

**Sweet Spot:** $2/rack = 5-7% of rack profit

-----

### MODEL 5: SaaS Subscription Tiers

**For Suppliers:**

|Tier |Price/Month|Features |Target Customer |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|Free |$0 |Up to 10 orders/month, basic tracking|Trial users |
|Starter |$99 |Unlimited orders, basic features |Small suppliers (1-25 restaurants) |
|Professional|$299 |+ Driver app, inventory, QuickBooks |Medium suppliers (26-75 restaurants)|
|Enterprise |$699 |+ Multi-location, white-label, API |Large suppliers (75+ restaurants) |

**For Restaurants:**

|Tier |Price/Month|Features |
|----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
|Free |$0 |Basic ordering, invoice tracking |
|Pro |$49 |+ Analytics, budget alerts, multi-location|
|Enterprise|$199 |+ API access, custom integrations |

**Revenue Projections (Conservative):**

Suppliers (assuming 80% choose Professional):

- 1,100 suppliers × 80% × $299/mo = $263,120/month
- **$3.16M annual recurring revenue**

Restaurants (assuming 10% upgrade to Pro):

- 5,000 restaurants × 10% × $49/mo = $24,500/month
- **$294K annual recurring revenue**

**Total Year 2 ARR: $3.45M**

-----

### MODEL 6: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**

- **Base fee:** $0.50 per order OR 0.5% of order value (whichever greater)
- **FREE for all to join** (no barrier)
- **FREE for restaurants** (100% free forever)
- **Premium add-ons (optional):**
- QuickBooks sync: +$99/mo
- Inventory management: +$149/mo
- Driver app unlimited: +$199/mo
- Full suite: $299/mo

**Why This Wins:**

- Zero friction to join
- Revenue scales with usage
- Premium upsells for power users
- Keeps restaurants free (they’re growth engine)

**Blended Revenue Model:**

|Year|Base Revenue (per-order)|Premium Add-ons|Total Revenue|
|----|------------------------|---------------|-------------|
|1 |$520K |$180K |$700K |
|2 |$2.6M |$900K |$3.5M |
|3 |$7.8M |$2.7M |$10.5M |
|5 |$26M |$9M |$35M |

## Partnership Structures

### Overview of Options

When partnering with the crawfish dealer who brings industry expertise, relationships, and serves as your pilot customer, there are multiple ways to structure the deal. Here are all options from most fair to most advantageous for you.

-----

### OPTION 1: True 50/50 Partnership (Most Fair)

**Equity Split:**

- 50% to you (technical co-founder)
- 50% to him (business co-founder)

**Terms:**

- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (both parties)
- Equal voting rights on major decisions
- Equal salaries once profitable
- Both fully committed

**Decision Rights:**

- Major decisions (fundraising, exit, C-suite hiring): Both must agree
- Day-to-day: You handle product/tech, he handles sales/ops

**Vesting Protection:**

- 1-year cliff: If either quits in Year 1 → gets 0%
- After 1 year: 25% vests
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over 3 years
- Exit acceleration: 50% vests immediately on acquisition

**Why This Works:**

- Maximum respect and trust
- Highly motivating for both
- True partnership mentality
- Clean and simple
- Standard for co-founder relationships

**Potential Issues:**

- Deadlock risk on disagreements
- May feel unfair later if contribution levels diverge

**Example Outcome (Exit at $500M):**

- You: $250M
- Him: $250M

-----

### OPTION 2: Sweat Equity Split - 60/40

**Equity Split:**

- 60% to you
- 40% to him

**Additional Terms:**

- He gets **10-15% of gross revenue** as revenue share
- Paid monthly/quarterly
- Comes before profit calculations
- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (both)

**The Logic:**

You’re contributing:

- 6-12 months building platform
- Ongoing technical maintenance
- Product strategy
- Potentially full-time earlier

He’s contributing:

- Sales & customer acquisition
- Industry expertise
- Relationship capital
- Ongoing operations

**Revenue Share Sweetener:**

Makes up for smaller equity stake with immediate cash flow

**Example Math (Year 2: $3.5M revenue):**

- His revenue share (15%): $525K paid to him
- His equity: 40% × $35M valuation = $14M (paper value)
- Your equity: 60% × $35M valuation = $21M (paper value)

**Why This Works:**

- Acknowledges different contribution levels
- Gives him immediate cash flow
- You get larger equity stake
- Both highly motivated

**Challenges:**

- Revenue share reduces reinvestment capital
- More complex structure
- Need clear revenue share terms

**Example Outcome (Exit at $500M after dilution):**

- You: 45% post-dilution = $225M
- Him: 30% post-dilution = $150M
- Plus: He received $700K+ in revenue share over years

-----

### OPTION 3: Founder + Key Employee - 70/30

**Equity Split:**

- 70% to you (founder/CEO)
- 30% to him (co-founder/COO or VP Sales)

**Additional Compensation:**

- $100-200K annual salary (once profitable)
- Performance bonuses tied to milestones:
- Hit 1,000 restaurants: $50K bonus
- Hit 5,000 restaurants: $100K bonus
- Hit $10M revenue: $250K bonus

**Terms:**

- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- You’re CEO, he’s COO/President
- Clear reporting structure

**The Logic:**

You’re the primary founder who:

- Had the original vision
- Building core product
- Taking bigger risk (leaving job first)
- Ultimately responsible for success/failure

He’s critical early team member who:

- Brings essential expertise
- Drives sales and adoption
- Gets meaningful equity
- Gets competitive salary + bonuses

**Why This Works:**

- Recognizes you as primary founder
- He still gets life-changing equity (30% of $500M = $150M)
- Salary/bonuses provide short-term motivation
- Clear hierarchy avoids confusion

**Potential Issues:**

- May feel less like “true partners”
- Could create resentment if company becomes huge
- Power dynamic less balanced

**Example Outcome (Exit at $500M after dilution):**

- You: 55% post-dilution = $275M
- Him: 23% post-dilution = $115M
- Plus: $500K+ in salaries and bonuses

-----

### OPTION 4: Advisor Equity + Revenue Share

**Equity Split:**

- 85-90% to you
- 10-15% to him (advisor/strategic partner)

**Additional Terms:**

- 20% revenue share from his sales activities
- No vesting (immediate ownership)
- He keeps running crawfish business
- Not full-time commitment

**The Logic:**

He’s NOT a full-time co-founder:

- Running existing business
- Helping part-time
- Providing connections
- Not building product

You’re doing everything:

- Building platform
- Full-time (or becoming full-time)
- Taking all risk
- Doing heavy lifting

**Revenue Share:**

- He gets 20% of revenue from customers he brings
- Paid monthly/quarterly
- Unlimited upside

**Example Math:**

- He brings 50 suppliers generating $1M revenue
- His revenue share: 20% = $200K/year
- His equity: 10% × $100M valuation = $10M

**Why This Could Work:**

- He doesn’t have to quit his business
- Immediate equity (no vesting risk)
- Big revenue share = immediate income
- You maintain control

**Challenges:**

- Less commitment from him
- May not feel like true partner
- Revenue share could get expensive
- Harder to collect from multiple revenue streams

**Example Outcome (Exit at $500M):**

- You: 80% = $400M
- Him: 10% = $50M
- Plus: $1-2M in revenue share over years

-----

### OPTION 5: The Hybrid Co-Founder Deal (RECOMMENDED)

**Equity Split:**

- 55% to you
- 45% to him

**Additional Terms:**

- He gets **5% revenue share** until earning $150K+/year from company
- Revenue share stops once salary reaches $150K
- Both vest over 4 years (1-year cliff)
- Equal voting rights on major decisions
- Equal salaries once profitable

**The Logic:**

Nearly 50/50 but acknowledges:

- You’re building core product (slight equity edge)
- He needs cash flow early (revenue share bridge)
- You’re true partners (equal decision-making)
- Both fully committed (both vest)

**Revenue Share Mechanics:**

- Paid monthly from gross revenue
- Stops when company can pay $150K salary
- Ensures cash flow while building

**Timeline Example:**

**Year 1:**

- $700K revenue → He gets $35K from revenue share
- No salaries yet (company not profitable)

**Year 2:**

- $3.5M revenue → He gets $175K from revenue share
- Revenue share STOPS (he’s making $150K+)
- Both start $150K salaries

**Year 3-5:**

- No revenue share
- Both on equal salaries ($200K+)
- Building equity value

**Exit (Year 6 at $500M):**

- After Series B dilution:
- You: 42% = $210M
- Him: 34% = $170M
- Plus: He received $210K in revenue share (Years 1-2)

**Why This Is Optimal:**

✅ Nearly equal partnership (45% vs 55%)
✅ Revenue share bridges cash needs early
✅ Clean, fair, respectful
✅ Both highly motivated
✅ Equal decision rights
✅ Vesting protects if things go wrong

**This is my #1 recommendation for fairness + practicality.**

## Cutthroat Deals (Knowledge Only)

**⚠️ WARNING: These structures are legal but ethically questionable. Documented here for educational purposes only. Using these will likely destroy relationships and potentially the business.**

### Why These Exist

In ruthless startup culture, some founders use these tactics to maximize their own outcome at the expense of partners. Common in:

- Silicon Valley when founders exploit less sophisticated partners
- When power dynamics are unequal
- Information asymmetry (one party doesn’t understand startup law)

**Famous Examples:**

- Facebook: Eduardo Saverin diluted from 34% → 0.03%
- Snapchat: Reggie Brown forced out, had to sue
- Tinder: Early employees told vested options worth “millions” were actually worth “$0”

-----

### Cutthroat Option 1: The Founder Trap

**Structure:**

- 95% equity to you
- 5% equity to him (non-voting)
- 10-year vesting with 2-year cliff
- 20% revenue share “of profits” (you control when there’s profit)
- At-will termination (you can fire him anytime)

**The Trap:**

**What he hears:**

> “You get 5% equity plus 20% of profits! Could be $200K+/year!”

**The Reality:**

- 10-year vest = he’ll never fully vest
- You control expenses = you control “profit”
- Years 1-5: “No profits yet, reinvesting everything”
- Year 8: Sell company (he’s only 80% vested = gets 4%)
- You: 95%, Him: 4% + maybe $100K total over 8 years

**Legal? Yes. Ethical? No.**

-----

### Cutthroat Option 2: Reverse Vesting Scam

**Structure:**

- 70% to you, 30% to him (seems fair!)
- His 30% granted upfront but reverse vests
- Reverse vest = he LOSES shares if misses targets
- Targets YOU control
- Clawback: If he leaves, you buy shares at $0.01/share

**The Trap:**

**Year 1:**

- Target: “Sign 50 suppliers by Month 6”
- You delay platform launch
- He misses target → Loses 10% → Now has 20%

**Year 2:**

- Target: “Hit $2M revenue”
- You delay key features
- He misses → Loses 10% → Now has 10%

**Year 3:**

- He’s frustrated, wants to leave
- Clawback: You buy his 10% for $1,000
- You now own 90%+

**Legal? Barely. Ethical? Hell no.**

-----

### Cutthroat Option 3: Equity Dilution Bomb

**Structure:**

- 50/50 equity split (seems fair!)
- BUT: 10M share option pool that dilutes HIM not YOU
- You have Preferred Stock, he has Common Stock
- Preferred gets 2x liquidation preference

**The Trap:**

**Initial Cap Table:**

- You: 50% (Preferred)
- Him: 50% (Common)

**Year 2: You “hire employees”**

- You grant yourself 3M “employee options”
- Give friends 2M shares as “advisors”
- New split: You 40%, Him 25% (he got diluted!)

**Year 4: Exit for $100M**

- Your Preferred: 2x liquidation preference
- You get $80M first
- Remaining $20M split among common holders
- Him: $20M × 25% = **$5M** (not $50M!)

**You walk with $80M, he walks with $5M on “50/50” deal.**

**Legal? Yes (standard VC structure). Ethical? No (misrepresenting fairness).**

-----

### Cutthroat Option 4: The Licensing Scam

**Structure:**

- You own 100% of software company
- He gets 0% equity
- You “license” software to him for $500/month
- He resells to suppliers
- License has termination clause

**The Trap:**

**Years 1-2:**

- He builds customer base (50 suppliers)
- Makes good money reselling
- Everything seems great

**Year 3:**

- You terminate his license (30 days notice)
- Email all HIS customers directly
- Offer direct pricing (cut him out)
- He loses ALL customers overnight
- You now have 50 customers, he has nothing

**Alternative:**

- Raise licensing fee every year
- Year 1: $500/mo
- Year 3: $10,000/mo
- His margin disappears, he quits

**Legal? Yes. Ethical? Absolutely not.**

-----

### Cutthroat Option 5: Phantom Equity

**Structure:**

- 85% real equity to you
- 15% “phantom equity” to him
- Phantom = not real stock, only pays IF profitable AND sold
- You define profitability

**The Trap:**

**What phantom equity means:**

- Not real stock (can’t sell, can’t vote)
- Only converts to cash if:
1. Company profitable (you control via expenses)
1. Company sold (you control timing)

**Scenario A: Never sell**

- Run company 20 years
- Keep “unprofitable” on paper
- He never gets paid = $0

**Scenario B: Sell when worth less**

- Year 3: Worth $50M (his 15% = $7.5M)
- You wait…
- Year 8: Worth $10M (declining)
- Sell now: His 15% = $1.5M
- You timed it to minimize payout

**Legal? Yes. Ethical? No.**

-----

### Cutthroat Option 6: The “Consultant” Trap

**Structure:**

- He’s not co-founder, he’s “consultant”
- 1-3% equity (advisor rate)
- $5K/month consulting fee
- Work for Hire = you own everything he contributes
- 2-year non-compete

**The Trap:**

**Year 1:**

- He introduces 50 suppliers (entire network)
- Provides all industry knowledge
- You pay him $60K

**Year 2:**

- Stop paying (“budget cuts”)
- He already gave you everything
- Work for Hire = you own his contributions
- Non-compete = he can’t build competing product
- 3% equity, 1.5% vested after 1 year
- You offer buyout: $10K
- He’s stuck

**You now have:** His network, his knowledge, 97%+ equity
**He has:** $70K total, no future

**Legal? Yes. Ethical? No.**

-----

### Why NOT to Use Cutthroat Deals

**The Math Doesn’t Work:**

**Fair Deal:**

- 45% of $500M = $225M for you
- He’s motivated, works hard, brings full value

**Cutthroat Deal:**

- 95% of $20M = $19M for you
- He sabotages, sues, or tells industry you’re unethical
- Business fails or severely limited

**You make MORE with a fair deal.**

**Additional Risks:**

- Lawsuits (expensive even if you win)
- Reputation damage (food distribution is small world)
- Karma (you get screwed later)
- Guilt (if you have a conscience)
- Sabotage (angry partners destroy value)

**Bottom line:** Be fair. You’ll make more money and sleep better.

-----

**Restaurant Incentive Program:**

- Recruit 2+ suppliers → Get $100 credit
- Or: Free premium features for 6 months
- Restaurants become your sales force

**Supplier Adoption:**

- 400 other suppliers
- 5,000 restaurants
- $3.5M annual revenue

-----

### Phase 4: Scale & Dominance (Years 3-5)

-----

## Financial Projections

### Conservative 5-Year Model (Hybrid Pricing)

**Assumptions:**

- $0.50 per order base fee

- 45% equity to him
- 5% revenue share until $150K salary
- 4-year vest with 1-year cliff
- Equal voting on major decisions

**Why This Works:**

- Nearly equal = true partnership
- Revenue share = practical cash flow
- Vesting = protection for both
- Both highly motivated
- Fair and sustainable

### For Business Model:

**RECOMMENDED MODEL:**

- $0.50 per order (or 0.5% of order value)
- FREE for restaurants (they recruit suppliers)
- FREE to join for suppliers
- Premium add-ons $99-299/mo

**Why This Works:**

- Zero barrier to entry
- Viral growth mechanics

- Premium upsells for power users

### For Go-To-Market:

**PHASE 1:** Get one lighthouse customer (equity deal)
**PHASE 2:** Expand through referrals (10 dealers)
**PHASE 3:** Restaurant recruitment drives viral growth
**PHASE 4:** Become industry standard
**PHASE 5:** Exit at $500M-1B valuation

### Expected Timeline:
