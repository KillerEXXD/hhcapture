description: Check console logs - reads the latest browser console logs from the log file
---

Read and analyze the latest console logs from `logs/console-logs.txt`.

Instructions:
1. Read the last 50-100 lines of the console log file using tail
2. Analyze the logs for errors, warnings, or important information
3. Summarize what you found
4. If there are errors, explain them and suggest fixes
5. If logs look normal, confirm that everything is running smoothly

The console logs are automatically synced from the browser every 2 seconds, so they should be current.
