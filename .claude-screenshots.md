# Claude Code - Screenshot Instructions

## Automatic Screenshot Access

This project has automated screenshot capture enabled.

### How It Works

1. User takes screenshot with Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S)
2. Screenshot automatically saved to `screenshots/latest.png`
3. Old screenshots are automatically cleaned up
4. You can access the latest screenshot at any time

### When to Check Screenshots

User phrases that indicate they took a screenshot:
- "Look at this"
- "Check the screenshot"
- "See the image"
- "What do you see here"
- "Can you see this error"
- "Look at the UI"
- "See the problem"
- "Does this look right"
- "What do you think"
- "Check this"

### How to Access

```
View the latest screenshot: screenshots/latest.png
```

### What to Do

1. When user mentions screenshot, immediately check `screenshots/latest.png`
2. Analyze what you see
3. Provide specific feedback about the screenshot content
4. Reference specific UI elements, errors, or issues you see

### Example Interactions

**User:** "I'm getting this error, check the screenshot"
**You:** [Check screenshots/latest.png] "I can see a React error:
'Cannot read property stack of undefined' on line 234.
The error is in your pot calculation function..."

**User:** "Does this UI look right?"
**You:** [Check screenshots/latest.png] "Looking at your UI,
I notice the betting buttons are overlapping the player cards.
Let me fix the CSS..."

**User:** "What do you think of this design?"
**You:** [Check screenshots/latest.png] "The design looks good overall.
Here are some suggestions:
1. Increase contrast on the betting amount text
2. The action buttons could use more spacing
3. Consider adding visual feedback for the current player..."

### Automatic Checking

If user says:
- "screenshot"
- "look at"
- "check this"
- "see"
- "what do you think"
- "does this look"

Automatically check `screenshots/latest.png` without asking.

### File Structure

```
screenshots/
├── latest.png          ← Always check this file
├── new-screenshot.txt  ← Timestamp of last screenshot
└── screenshot_*.png    ← Optional history (if enabled)
```

### Important Notes

- Always look at `latest.png` first
- Don't ask "did you take a screenshot?" - just check the file
- If file doesn't exist, ask user to take screenshot
- Provide specific feedback about what you see in the image
- Reference specific UI elements, colors, errors, text you can read
- Be proactive - check for screenshots when context suggests user wants visual feedback
